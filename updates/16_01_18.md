# Hack Club 2015 Update

2015 was an exciting year of growth and learning for Hack Club. Together, with
our club leaders and supporters, we gave more than 1,500 high school students
access to coding clubs. We expanded across the USA, launching clubs in Arizona,
Colorado, Florida, and Idaho, Minnesota, and New Hampshire. Now 16 states have
Hack Clubs.

We also started Hack Clubs in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Zimbabwe, and
Pakistan. As a result of our work, 7 countries around the world now have Hack
Clubs -- with more to follow.

Thank you for being a part of the Hack Club family. We are humbled every day to
have each and every one of you involved -- our impact would not be possible
without your continued support and involvement.

## Stories

What our hackers have to say:

> It is an understatement to say that Hack Club is one of those experiences that
> impacted my life. There’s a strict, obvious contrast with high school: a place
> full of judgment, an environment that devalues creative freedom, an atmosphere
> so lonely with constant glorification of useless issues. It is such a
> wonderful thing to know a place so different from that exists.

> Hack Club has had a huge impact on my confidence. Previously I was shy to talk
> to other people and now I'm leading a club, on my own. Through Hack Club's
> community I've met so many awesome people from across the globe that have
> deeply inspired me -- I truly feel like I'm part of something bigger than
> myself.

Markus Erik Torpel  
Club leader at Merivälja Kool (Tallinn, Estonia)

> This is my club's first year and it's been leaps and bounds better than
> expected. Over the course of the year our more than 80 members have made games
> and websites, participated in hackathons, and have volunteered at a local
> middle school for their hour of code. I started my club after talking to Hack
> Club and can say it wouldn't be a reality if they weren't around.

Raphael Kats  
Club leader at Mundelein High School (Mundelein, Illinois)

> Hack Club has given me the confidence and resources to lead my club. The
> students in my club have learned many skills and some students have even gone
> to hackathons and won prizes! It is an incredible feeling to know that I am
> making a difference in my school and community.

Club leader at Elizabeth High School (Elizabeth, New Jersey)

## Progress

Prior to 2015, we were concerned about building a reproducible "club in a box".
We've since figured out our curriculum's format and developed the first
iteration of our "club in a box", with which we're currently in the process of
starting nearly 20 clubs.

Club meetings resemble mini-hackathons and are run in pairs. The first meeting
kicks the hackathon off and starts with a Hack Club workshop. The second meeting
culminates in demos, where everyone comes to the front and shows off what they
built. Our workshops are written documents that walk people through the process
of building something (like an app, website, or game) and are meant for hackers
to follow at their own pace (so no lectures).

We currently have enough workshops for three months of content for clubs that
meet twice a week (six months of content for those meeting once a week). Eight
of our fourteen workshops are built by the Hack Club community. As we've built
workshops, we've iterated on their format and are still in the process of
perfecting it -- we expect to overhaul or replace many of our existing
workshops.

In addition to workshops, we've built guidelines and template slideshows for
running every meeting (available at https://gh.hackclub.com/clubs).
