hackEDU is the worldwide movement of free student-led coding clubs. We provide a
"club playbook" for high school students starting clubs at their schools and
build a tightly-knit community of club leaders.

**Where do you live now, and where would the organization be based after YC?**

SF. SF.

**Email address we should contact you at**

zach@hackedu.us

**Phone number(s)**

- zach@hackedu.us
- jonathan@hackedu.us

**Please enter the url of a 1 minute unlisted (not private) YouTube video
introducing the founders.**

TODO

**Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or
work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible.**

We wrote a script that exploits referral codes to order food with delivery for
less than $2 per meal. We used it nearly every weekday from November to June
2014 to cut costs.

**How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any
of the founders not met in person?**

We've known each other since September 2014 (13 months) and have been living
together since November 2014 (11 months). We met after a mutual friend
introduced Zach, who had just won PennApps, the University of Pennsylvania's
hackathon, to Jonathan, who was a former lead organizer of PennApps.

**How far along are you?**

We're running an extended pilot with 47 schools across 11 states and 4
countries, reaching 1500 students. 32% of our members are female (nearly 2x the
national average) and 37% are minorities in tech (7x industry average).

**If you've already started working on it, how long have you been working and
how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?**

We've been working on hackEDU full-time for 11 months.

- Lines of code: 12,333 across 349 files (excludes 2113 blank lines)
- Lines of Markdown: 31,199 across 348 files (148,653 words)

Note: given the nature of our work, most of our development happens in Markdown
files.

**Which of the following best describes your progress?**

- [ ] Nothing Built
- [ ] Sketches
- [ ] Mocks / Renderings
- [ ] Prototype
- [x] Private Beta
- [ ] Public Beta
- [ ] Taking Preorders
- [ ] Launched

**Do you have revenue?**

- [ ] No
- [x] Yes

**How much revenue?**

$91,715.00

**If you've applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you
made since the last time you applied? Anything change?**

- Onboarded 11 more schools
- Ran Hack Camp
- Figured out format for curriculum and clubs
- Brought on Dave at Director of Community
- Started Labs

**If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator,
"accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.**

We have not.

**Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this
area? How do you know this is going to work?**

TODO

**What's new about what you plan to do?**

Two primary things:

1. Unlike similar initiatives like X, Y, and Z that require finding a location,
   recruiting volunteers, and hiring teachers, we provide a playbook that
   enables students to start their own clubs without requiring us to recruit
   volunteers or maintain partnerships with schools. We're building Airbnb, not
   a chain of hotels.
2. While other initiatives, like Girls Who Code, believe in the power of
   intellectual property, we believe we can build better materials if everyone
   is part of the conversation and contributing. We're almost entirely open
   source with everything from our
   [club playbook](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu) to our
   [financials](https://github.com/hackedu/finances) on our GitHub. The only
   thing we don't make public is personal student data.

**Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?**

Yes.

**What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?**

Delaware non-stock non-profit corporation.

**If you're already incorporated, when were you? If you've had funding, how
much and from whom?**

hackEDU was incoporated in January 2014. We've secured $91,715.00 in donations.

**Have you obtained your 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status yet?**

No.

**Please provide any other relevant information about the structure or
formation of the company.**

We have partnered with Mission Bit (http://www.missionbit.com/) as our fiscal
sponsor with a 3% fee and direct access to our bank account (industry standard
is 7-12% without direct access to a bank account).

**Are any of the following true?**

- You are the only founder.
- You are a student who may return to school when the next term starts.
- Half or more of your group can't move to the Bay Area.
- One or more founders will keep their current jobs.

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No

**If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them.
One may be something we've been waiting for.**

**Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has
discovered. (The answer need not be related to your project.)**

`fortune | cowsay | lolcat` speaks volumes of truth.

**What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator?**

Engaging with the community on Hacker News, meeting partners, and meeting YC
founders, some of whom encouraged us and helped us apply (thank you!).

**How did you hear about Y Combinator?**

Hacker News.

**Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some
(non-computer) system to your advantage.**

I hacked my high school education. I exploited a loophole in the California K-12
education system to get twice the credits in half the time. College credits
count for twice the amount of high school credits and for core classes, like
language, count for four times the credits. By taking college level classes
full-time, I could have graduated in two years---but I ended up testing out
anyway in one and a half instead.

**Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other
than this startup that you have built or achieved.**

In my freshman year of high school, I joined Run Games as the first employee and
brought our game from an early prototype to launching in the App Store and
getting over one million users. We reached #5 in the top free charts, #1 in
games, #1 in sports, #1 in arcade, and were featured by Apple on the front page
of the App Store.
