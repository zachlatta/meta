### Project Name

hackEDU

### Project Description

hackEDU helps high school students start coding clubs. We provide prospective
club leaders with open-source materials for starting clubs and with a supportive
community of leaders around the globe. Our club playbook contains facilitation
guidelines and workshops that focus on shipping cool projects in under 60
minutes (ex. https://git.io/vCsTC).

Our goal is to provide every student, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or
socioeconomic status, the opportunity to experience the joys of building things
with code because we believe coding is one of the most empowering things someone
can learn. If we're able to accomplish this, not only does that mean a larger
and more diverse technology workforce, but it means living in a more empowered
world where more people create the change they want to see. And that is a world
we want to live in.

## In-Depth Information

### Statement of Need

The lack of access to computer science education is a national problem.
Computing jobs are growing at twice the national rate of other types of jobs
[0]. By 2020, accordingly to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be 1
million more computing jobs than graduates to fill them [1].

3 in 5 STEM college students decide to study STEM in high school [2], but in a
survey conducted by Google in August 2015 found that only one in four schools
surveyed offered computer science programs, with Black and lower-income
communities having the least access [3]. Bringing a computer science program to
a school requires school and district administrator buy-in, but less than half
of the principals and superintendents surveyed said that their school board
thinks offering computer science education is important.

We think that a low-cost program that introduces computer science
education to a school without administrator buy-in would give more students
access to computer science. We think our clubs program is just that. Since our
clubs are regular school clubs, like a chess club, our leaders don't need to
find their own space (the school is their space), recruit external volunteers
(their friends are volunteers), or hire teachers (they teach using our
pre-written workshops). This model makes the cost of starting a new club
virtually $0 from our end and we think it'll let us scale where others haven't.
